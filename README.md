# Purpose

This project will replace [nodules](https://github.com/unixpickle/nodules). I will use it on my VPS to host my domains and their various worker tasks.

# Language Choice

Last time I wrote a project like this, I chose to use CoffeeScript and Node.js. This time around, I am using Go. I hope this will improve performance, maintainability, and stability.

**Disclaimer**: At the time of starting this project, I have been programming in Go for roughly two days. I bet it's fine, though, because Go is super easy to learn.
